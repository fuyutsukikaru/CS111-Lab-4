# EXERCISE 1: What method you used to make your peer download and upload
#    files in parallel?  (~1-3 sentences)
We used fork() in order to create child processes that would run the download and
the upload in parallel. It had a child count that kept running waitpid until the count
reached 0.

# EXERCISE 2A: What conditions did you find and fix that would have
#    triggered a buffer overrun bug?  (~1-3 sentences each)
Rather than using strcpy in start_download and task_download, we used strncpy to copy
exactly the FILENAMESIZ so that we could prevent a malicious download from causing
a buffer overflow.

# EXERCISE 2B: What other robustness problems did you fix?  (~1-3 sentences
#    each)
We checked to make sure that the directory that we were downloading from did not contain
a '/' so that it would not download to an invalid directory.
We also made sure that the size of the file buffer was not larger than the FILENAMESIZ
to ensure that our buffers would not overflow.

# EXERCISE 3: Describe the attacks you implemented for "evil mode".  Why
#    are they attacks?  (~3-10 sentences each)

# Extra credit problems
#Extra credit problem: none

# Add any other information you'd like us to know below this line.
